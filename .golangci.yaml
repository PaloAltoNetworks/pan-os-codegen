    #- wrapcheck  # this one will be useful, but we have to fix a multitude of errors
    #- unparam  # when fixed, probably already covered by revive/gocritic
    #- revive  # too many errors, but useful, similar to gocritic, so probably choose one
    #- prealloc  # enable when can
    #- nestif  # enable once we clean up the code
    #- gofumpt  # fix all files before we switch to gofumpt
    #- gocritic  # too many failures for now
    #- goconst  # once we rewrite string literals to consts
    #- gochecknoglobals  # once we rewrite terraform codegen and drop global functions
    #- funlen  # couple of functions over 60 lines
    #- err113  # disabled because of too many dynamic errors that don't wrap anything
